There is a collection of photos to place into an empty photo album, one at a time by order of importance. 
Each time a photo is inserted, all subsequent photos are shifted toward the right by one position. 
Given the idâ€™s of the photos and the positions where each should be placed, 
find out the sequence of the photos in the album after all photos have been inserted.

Example

n = 5
index = [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]
identity = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

The sequence of the photos is as follows:
    The photos 0, 1 and 2 keep the same indexes 0, 1 and 2 respectively.
    The photo 3 is inserted in index 1 and the subsequent photos 1 and 2 are shifted right by one position.
    The photo 4 is inserted in position 2 and again the photos 1 and 2 are shifted right by one position.
